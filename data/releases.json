    "description": "Our debut single. A cosmic horror anthem of divine consumption. As tendrils descend from a bruising sky, life itself is siphoned upward; blood and starlight feeding a mouth unseen. Streets fall silent, windows frost from within, and the world's marrow is harvested into shrinking skies. Where once the world was loud with birth, stillness carves its throne. A meditation on the end of creation, where atmosphere, dread, and awe collapse into something vast and visceral.",
